        <h2>Hey there! I'm Ruba, 👋🏼</h2>
        <p> a software engineer with a passion for creating digital diaries. ✨</p>
        <p>
            I built this website
            to share my personal diaries and the templates I design, hoping to inspire others to document their thoughts, experiences, and memories.
        </p>

        <p> Feel free to explore, get inspired, and make these templates your own. I’d love to hear your thoughts and see how you use them!
